# TrapMap

A Trapezoidal Map library; a data structure for fast point location queries.

Trapezoidal Map from a set of non-intersecting lines (a *planar straight-line graph*)

A demonstration of the Randomized Trapezoidal Map for Point Search.

The expected query time for an query point is *O(log n)*.

Given a partition of the space into disjoint regions, to determine the region where a query point lies.

A point location query is to ask in which region (face) of a map a given point lie.

arbitrary polygons (not just triangles for example)

The algorithm has been extracted from AWT Tyler Chenhall's Java [applet](https://github.com/TylerChenhall/TrapezoidalMap) and turned into this usable library.

The arrangement faces are decomposed into simpler cells each of constant complexity, known as pseudo-trapezoids, and a search structure (a directed acyclic graph) is constructed on top of these cells, facilitating the search of the pseudo trapezoid (hence the arrangement cell) containing a query point in expected logarithmic time. The trapezoidal map and the search structure are built by a randomized incremental construction algorithm (RIC).

## Project Description
This repository demonstrates the Randomized Trapezoidal Map, as described in de Berg's Computational Geometry textbook. The project shuffles the segment list and builds a trapezoidal map (in order to achieve expected construction and query times of O(nlog(n)) and O(log(n)), respectively, where n is the number of segments.

## Usage

* `findTrapezoid()` find the trapezoid containing the query point.
* `findTrapezoids()` finds the trapezoids which constitute the polygonal face in which the query point lies.
  * This face is "emergent" from the line segments, depending on their intersection.

Note: Handles vertical lines.



### From line segments

### From polygonal shapes

Notably, trapezoids have a pointer back to the original, acessible via `findFace()`.

## Degenerate

In degenerate situations the query point can lie on an edge, or coincide with a vertex???
Vertical line???
